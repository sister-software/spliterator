# Spliterator ðŸŽ€

Spliterator is a TypeScript library for streaming delimited content such as CSV, TSV and JSONL.

Let's say you have a huge newline-delimited JSON file that can't fit into memory:

```js
{"name": "Jessie", "age": 30}
{"name": "Kelly", "age": 40}
{"name": "Loren", "age": 50}
// Several hundred thousand more lines...
```

Spliterator can help you read it line-by-line without loading the entire file into memory:

```ts
import { JSONSpliterator } from "spliterator"

interface Person {
	name: string
	age: number
}

const reader = JSONSpliterator.fromAsync("example.jsonl")

for await (const line of reader) {
	console.log(line) // {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}, etc.
}
```

# Installation

```bash
yarn add spliterator
# or
npm install spliterator
```

# Usage

## Character-delimited files

While Spliterator supports any delimited byte stream, it's particularly useful for character-delimited content such as comma-separated values (CSV), tab-separated values (TSV) â€“ or any other delimiter you can think of.

```csv
Full Name, Occupation, Age
Morgan, Developer, 30
Nataly, Designer, 40
Orlando, Manager, 50
```

```ts
import { CSVSpliterator } from "spliterator"

const reader = CSVSpliterator.fromAsync("people.csv")

for await (const columns of reader) {
	console.log(columns) // ["Full Name", "Occupation", "Age"], ["Morgan", "Developer", 30], etc.
}
```

CSV files can also be emitted as objects with headers as keys, with some quality-of-life features, such as normalizing property keys:

```ts
import { CSVSpliterator } from "spliterator"

interface Person {
	full_name: string
	occupation: string
	age: number
}

const reader = CSVSpliterator.fromAsync<Person>("people.csv", { mode: "object" })

for await (const columns of reader) {
	console.log(columns) // { full_name: "Morgan", occupation: "Developer", age: 30 }, etc.
}
```

## CLI Usage

Spliterator also includes a CLI tool that can be used to stream delimited content from the command line, transform it, filter it, and more.

```bash
spliterator csv people.csv people.jsonl
```

The CLI also supports reading from standard input:

```bash
cat people.csv | spliterator csv people.jsonl
```

For information on all available commands, run `spliterator --help`.

## Advanced Usage

Spliterator includes a collection of low-level classes and interfaces that can be used to create custom generators for any kind of delimited content.

For more advanced usage, check out our tests in the `test` directory, or our fully-annotated source code.

### Reading from a stream

All included Spliterators implement the `Generator` and `AsyncGenerator` interfaces, so you can use them in `for...of` and `for await...of` loops, as well the web-native [ReadableStreams](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream), so you can use them in `for await...of` loops, as well as piping them through transformations to avoid nested and partially materialized streams.

```ts
import { JSONSpliterator } from "spliterator"

const people = [
	{ name: "Alice", age: 30 },
	{ name: "Bob", age: 40 },
	{ name: "Charlie", age: 50 },
]

const generator = JSONSpliterator.from(people.map(JSON.stringify).join("\n"))
const stream = ReadableStream.from(generator)

for await (const line of stream) {
	console.log(line) // {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}, etc.
}
```

### Custom generators

While Spliterator includes premade exports for most use-cases, custom generators can be created via `Spliterator` and `AsyncSpliterator`. This class is a low-level interface that allows you to create your own generators for any kind of delimited content.
